This React functional component is designed to update a user's profile information. It includes sections for uploading photos, editing profile details, and other settings. The component uses various hooks from React and Effector to manage state and side effects.

The component fetches the current profile data when the page loads and updates it when the form is submitted. It also handles errors and loading states using Effector's mutation and query APIs. The component includes validation for mandatory fields, error messages for invalid input, and success messages after a successful update.
