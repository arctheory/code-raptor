The code provided is a set of Effector samples that manage the state of profile photos in an application. It includes events to update, remove, add, and cancel photo uploads, as well as reset the profile data. The code uses various filters and transformations to ensure data consistency and integrity.

The samples are designed to work together seamlessly, with each sample building upon the previous one to create a robust and efficient system for managing profile photos. For example, when a new photo is added, the sample checks if the file size exceeds 5MB before adding it to the list of profile photos. Similarly, when an existing photo is removed, the sample updates the status of all other photos in the list accordingly.

The code also includes error handling mechanisms, such as checking for successful or failed uploads and updating the status of affected photos accordingly.
