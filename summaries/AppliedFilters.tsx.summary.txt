The code provided is a React functional component named `AppliedFilters` that displays a list of filters applied to a profile. The component uses the `react-icons` library to display icons, and it utilizes various utility functions from the `~/utils/helpers` module.

The component takes an object with filter keys as its props, where each key corresponds to a specific field in the profile (e.g., 'date_of_birth', 'height', etc.). The values associated with these keys are arrays of numbers or strings that represent the options for each field.
