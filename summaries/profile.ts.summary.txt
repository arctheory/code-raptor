The provided Effector code is a complex system that manages profiles, including fetching, saving, updating, and removing them. The code utilizes various events, queries, and mutations to achieve this functionality.

The code uses a combination of event-driven programming and data caching to optimize performance. It also employs a robust error handling mechanism to ensure that the application remains stable even in the presence of failures.

One notable aspect of the code is its use of the `sample` function from Effector's `sample` module, which allows for more complex event handling scenarios. This enables the system to respond to multiple events simultaneously and handle them accordingly.

The code also makes use of various data structures, such as the `$profilesRepository` store, which serves as a centralized cache for profiles. This approach helps to reduce the number of requests made to external APIs or services, improving overall performance.
