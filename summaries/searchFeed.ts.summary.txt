This code appears to be setting up an Effector store for a search feed feature. It defines several events, including `setSearchQueryEvent` and `loadMoreResultsEvent`, which trigger different actions in the store. The store itself is created using the `feedStoreTemplate` function, which takes in various dependencies such as queries and mutations.

The code also sets up two samples that filter the search query based on its length. One sample resets the feed when the query has less than 3 characters, while the other fetches the feed when the query has 3 or more characters. Additionally, there's a sample that loads more results when the `loadMoreResultsEvent` is triggered.
