The UserDao class provides a set of methods to interact with the User entity in the database. The methods include:

* `getAll()`: Returns a list of all users.
* `getOne(Long id)`: Finds one user by id and returns it as an Optional. If no user is found, it throws an EntityNotFoundException.
* `addOne(User user)`: Adds a new user to the database. If a user with the same id or email already exists, it throws an EntityExistsException.
* `updateOne(User user)`: Updates an existing user in the database. It checks if the user exists and if the email is already taken before updating the user.
* `deleteOne(Long id)`: Deletes a user by id from the database.

The class also includes several helper methods to generate error messages for specific scenarios.
