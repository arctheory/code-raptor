This SQL code creates a new schema named 'main' in the current PostgreSQL database. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it works:
- The 'CREATE SCHEMA' command is used to create a new schema.
- The 'IF NOT EXISTS' clause is optional, but it prevents an error from being raised if the schema already exists.
- The 'main' keyword specifies that the schema should be named 'main'.
- After executing this command, the 'main' schema will be created in the database, and any subsequent SQL commands can reference objects within this schema.
