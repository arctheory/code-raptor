This code is used to configure the Maven wrapper, which allows users to run Maven commands without having to download the entire Apache Maven distribution. The `distributionUrl` specifies the location of the Apache Maven distribution, while the `wrapperUrl` points to the Maven wrapper JAR file. This configuration enables users to easily manage their project dependencies and build processes.
