This Java code is a basic example of a Spring Boot application. It starts a server and prints its host and port to the console. The main steps involved are:
1. Starting the Spring Boot application context using `SpringApplication.run`.
2. Retrieving the host and port from the environment properties.
3. Logging an information message indicating that the server has started.
