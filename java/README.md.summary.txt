This code provides a basic structure for creating a Spring Boot API with PostgreSQL connectivity. It includes essential commands and configurations for setting up the project, as well as an organization pattern that follows standard Java-based architecture principles.

The key components of this project include:

*   Manual database setup using PostgreSQL JDBC driver
*   Exclusion of DataSourceAutoConfiguration class to allow manual configuration
*   Organization pattern: Controller -> Service -> DAO -> Repo -> Entity
*   Useful commands for starting the server, installing pom files, and skipping tests

Overall, this code serves as a starting point for building more complex Spring Boot applications with PostgreSQL connectivity.
