      "Summary for /Users/anudeep/Downloads/simple-spring-boot-master/src/main/java/com/example/firstmvn/services/UserService.java: The given code is a Java class named UserService that serves as a business logic layer for user management. It utilizes the Spring framework and interacts with the UserDao, which is responsible for database operations related to users. The class provides methods for retrieving all users, getting one user by id, adding a new user, updating an existing user, and deleting a user by id.\n",
      "\n",
      "The code adheres to the principles of dependency inversion, where the UserService class depends on the UserDao interface rather than the concrete implementation. This allows for easier testing and maintenance of the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of exceptions such as EntityExistsException and EntityNotFoundException provides a way to handle specific error scenarios that may occur during user management operations.\n",

It uses Spring Boot framework to create a RESTful web service. The controller has methods to fetch all users, find one user by ID, add a new user, update an existing user, and delete a user by ID.\n",
      "\n",
      "The constructor of the controller takes a UserService object as a parameter, which is used to perform operations on users. The controller uses Spring's annotation-based configuration to map HTTP requests to specific methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "The code uses Java 8 features such as lambda expressions and method references to simplify the implementation of the controller methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "The controller returns ResponseEntity objects that contain the response data and an HTTP status code. The response data can be a list of users, a single user object, or a success message.\n",
      "Summary for /Users/anudeep/Downloads/simple-spring-boot-master/src/main/java/com/example/firstmvn/entities/User.java: This Java code defines a class named `User` which represents an entity in a database. The class is annotated with `@Entity` to indicate that it's a JPA (Java Persistence API) entity, and `@Table(name = \"users\")` specifies the name of the table in the database where this entity will be stored.\n",

      "\n",
      "The code then configures the application to exclude the DataSourceAutoConfiguration class, allowing for manual database setup. The PostgreSQL JDBC driver is connected to the database, and useful commands are provided for starting the server in dev mode, installing pom files, and skipping tests.\n",
      "\n",
      "The organization of the project follows a standard pattern, with controllers advising services, which in turn advise data access objects (DAOs). The DAOs interact with repository interfaces, which encapsulate database operations. Entity classes represent the data models used by the application.\n",
      "Summary for /Users/anudeep/Downloads/simple-spring-boot-master/src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__init.sql: The given SQL code is used to create a new schema named 'main' in a PostgreSQL database. The 'IF NOT EXISTS' clause ensures that the schema is only created if it does not already exist.\n",
      "Summary for /Users/anudeep/Downloads/simple-spring-boot-master/src/main/resources/application.properties: This code snippet appears to be a configuration file for a Spring Boot application. It sets up various settings for the server, database connection, and Hibernate/JPA configurations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The code starts by setting the server port to 3000 and enabling hot reload on file changes using `spring.devtools.restart.enabled = true`. This allows the application to automatically restart when changes are made to the codebase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, it configures the database settings. The database name is set to \"practice\", and the URL, username, and password are set accordingly. The JDBC settings are also configured, including the data source URL, username, and password.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hibernate/JPA configurations are then set up. The `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` property is set to \"update\", which means that Hibernate will update the database schema when the application starts. The `spring.jpa.hibernate.naming.physical-strategy` property is set to a custom implementation, which allows for more control over the naming strategy used by Hibernate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the code sets up Flyway settings, which are used to manage database migrations. The URL, schemas, user, and password are all configured accordingly.\n",

      "- A logger instance (`LOGGER`) is created to log messages during the execution of the program.\n",
      "- In the `main` method, the `SpringApplication.run` method is called with the current class and command-line arguments. This starts the Spring Boot application context.\n",
      "- The `ConfigurableApplicationContext` object obtained from `SpringApplication.run` provides access to various properties and beans in the application context.\n",
      "- The host and port of the server are retrieved using the `getEnvironment().getProperty(\"server.port\")` method, which returns a string representing the port number.\n",
      "- Finally, the logger prints out an information message indicating that the Spring Boot server has started on localhost with the specified port.\n",
