The files collectively outline the project's structure and provide necessary configurations for setting up the environment and running the application.\n",

It sets up the server port, enables hot reload on file changes, and configures the database connection using PostgreSQL. The JDBC settings are used to connect to the database, and Flyway is used for schema management.\n",

It provides endpoints for fetching all users, finding one user by ID, adding a new user, updating an existing user, and deleting a user by ID. The controller uses the Spring framework and relies on a UserService to perform the actual operations.\n",

The @SpringBootApplication annotation indicates that this class is the main entry point of the application, and it uses the SpringApplication.run method to start the server.\n",
      "(File: UserService.java) This Java class provides a business logic layer for user management. It uses dependency injection to receive a UserDao instance, which is responsible for interacting with the database. The UserService class offers methods to retrieve all users, get one user by id, add a new user, update an existing user, and delete a user by id.\n",
